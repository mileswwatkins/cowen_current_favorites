# Cowen Current Favorites

Tyler Cowen is an American University economics professor who moonlights as an [ethnic food blogger](https://tylercowensethnicdiningguide.com) for the DC metro area.

The ["Current Favorites" map](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1E3GrZSdl2AI4EZUbFtf5elQLZRZhkJlBdIMyDuk#map:id=3) linked on his website is a couple years out of date, so I wrote a quick scraper and Google Maps view to see what restaurants he's into now!
